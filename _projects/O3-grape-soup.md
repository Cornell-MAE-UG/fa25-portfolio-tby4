# Preventing SLF Contamination in Grape Harvests

**Team:** _Grape Soup_  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement 

Spotted lanternflies (SLFs) are harming grape growers and processors in infested U.S. vineyard regions by contaminating mechanically harvested grapes when insects on the vines are harvested along with the fruit. USDA reports about **923,000 bearing acres of grapes** and **5.40 million tons of utilized grape production (2024)** in comparable states, and USDA APHIS reports SLF populations in **19 states plus D.C.** Current harvesting and shaking methods are not selective enough to remove SLFs without also damaging fruit or reducing harvest efficiency, so insects can enter bins and downstream processing. A recent regional grape program report also identifies mechanized harvesting contamination as a specific SLF risk in highly mechanized grape regions.

## Impact

If this problem is solved, wineries would have cleaner harvested fruit, less contamination in juice/wine processing, and potentially less labor/time spent on manual sorting or cleanup.

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): Density-Based Flotation Separation Station

**What it is:**  
A receiving-area separation system that uses filtration plus flotation in water to separate SLFs from harvested grapes based on mass/buoyancy differences.

**How it would be used:**
- Harvester bins are emptied into a funnel that filters liquids from solids.
- The remaining solids (grapes and SLFs) enter a water-filled flotation tank.
- SLFs float and are skimmed from the surface.
- Clean grapes drain from the bottom and continue into existing processing equipment.

**Why it’s better than the status quo:**
- Targets SLF removal without requiring selective harvesting in the vineyard.
- Could reduce manual sorting/cleanup time during receiving and processing.
- Designed to integrate with established receiving workflows as a standalone station.

**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:**  
Build a small-scale separator to validate separation efficiency using water, grapes, and objects resembling SLF weight. Measure:
- % SLF successfully removed
- % grapes lost to the surface
- separation time / throughput

## Key risks / unknowns

- **Density/behavior overlap** — Damaged fruit (“grape soup”), stems, and debris may alter buoyancy and reduce separation effectiveness; test with mixed debris and damaged grapes in lab trials.
- **Fruit quality and contamination risk** — Water exposure may affect fruit quality or introduce sanitation concerns; test short exposure times and assess practical cleaning/handling needs.
- **Scale-up and workflow integration** — Lab performance may not translate to debris-heavy, high-throughput conditions; prototype for continuous flow and evaluate bottlenecks (skimming, drain clogging, tank turnover).

## Questions for the client

1. **What are current workflow/constraints for post-harvest processing at receiving?**  
   *Decision affected:* Where the system can be placed, required footprint, and what interfaces (bins, conveyors, drains) we must match.

2. **What percentage of harvest typically consists of alternative debris (e.g., stems, leaves), and what is the current removal process?**  
   *Decision affected:* Whether we need pre-screening stages and what debris-handling features (filters, clog prevention) are necessary.
