## 1. Device Selection and Real-World Context

### 1.1 Device Overview
The device analyzed in this portfolio is a **VIVOSUN 400 GPH Submersible Pump**, a commercially available small centrifugal pump designed to circulate water in tanks, fountains, and small process loops. According to the manufacturer, this pump is suitable for applications such as aquariums, hydroponic systems, and tabletop water circulation.

**Product reference:**

This pump is powered by an electric motor housed within a waterproof casing. The motor drives a centrifugal impeller that increases the mechanical energy of the water, thereby increasing its pressure and allowing it to flow through connected tubing against gravity and friction.

### 1.2 Real-World Examples of Pumps
Pumps similar to this one are used in many engineering and everyday contexts, including:

*   Building HVAC hydronic loops (circulator pumps)
*   Municipal and industrial water distribution
*   Cooling loops in power plants and machinery
*   Automotive cooling systems
*   Aquaculture and hobbyist water circulation

These applications all share the common thermodynamic principle that a pump is a **work-input device** that transfers mechanical work to a fluid to increase its mechanical energy.

## 2. System Diagram and Thermodynamic Analysis

### 2.1 Control Volume Description
The system is modeled as a **Steady-Flow Control Volume (CV)** enclosing the pump mechanism. The boundary cuts through the inlet pipe (suction side) and the discharge tubing (outlet side), as well as the electrical driveshaft.
